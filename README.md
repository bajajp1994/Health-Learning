This app uses computer vision to assist in the diagnosis of asperger's syndrome sufferers. By putting patients with Asperger Syndrome to the test in various contexts, this project is a learning tool to assist them. It is broken down into two sections, the first of which is used to evaluate a patient's emotions using a series of random images, and the second of which involves a brief exam on a fixed interval of learning to gauge the patient's reaction.
